# HospitalInventoryMangement

### Using Solidity smart contracts and blockchain technology to track products within an intra-hospital environment

# Business Objective: 

### Using smart contracts we can safely and securely move inventory products down the intra-organizational supply chain of the hospital from when it is delivered by the distributor to the product being used on patients. Once the inventory is received at the docking station a sku/QR code will be created for each piece of inventory to track the product. From there it goes to the onsite storage facility for their inventory to the department that needs it, to the pharmacy within that department, to the nurse and then to the patient. 

# Business Rules: 

## Inventory (item_ids) - Individual Items
## Product (product_ids) - Types of Items
## Location (location_ids) - Where the items are
## Employee (employee_ids) - Who is transferring the item
